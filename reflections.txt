How long did you spend working on this project?

I think the total was about 6 hours plus 5 hours to create two additional features.

What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?

I was working around 3 hours per day, until I left because of my vacations and
later I had college exams, so I spent 20 days without touching the code.
Then I didn't know where to start to add the additional features that I had to build but
the comments that I had written were very helpful!

What two additional features did you build? Why?
I built "Search a transaction by customer" and "Search a transaction by product", I think that can be very useful.

Where do you still have room to grow?
Everywhere! I have to work more with big files and complex databases. Also, I need
more practice to think more effectively.
